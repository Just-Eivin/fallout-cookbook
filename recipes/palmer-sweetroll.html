            <li>1 cup lukewarm (110°F) milk</li>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, divided</li>

            <li>3/4 teaspoon ground star anise, divided</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground star anise</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>ICING: </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>Pinch of ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin making the sweetroll dough by combining the lukewarm milk and yeast in a small cup.</li>
            <li>In a stand mixer fitted with the dough attachment, combine 4 tablespoons of the butter,
                sugar, and salt. Once well combined, add the egg and vanilla. Then pour in the milk
                and yeast mixture. Next, odd 1/4 teaspoon of the star anise and the flour. Mix until combined,
                but do not overmix, or the dough will be tough.
            </li>
            <li>After the flour has incorporated, take the dough out of the bowl and knead by hand for 5 minutes.
                Place the dough in a greased bowl (use nonstick spray) and cover. Allow to rise for at least
                2 hours, until double in size.
            </li>
            <li>After the dough has risen, preheat the oven to 350°F and grease two round cake pans (use nonstick spray)</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, star anise, and cardamom.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough out into a rectangular shape without rolling it too thin. Take the remaining butter, soften it, then spread it over the top
                of the dough using your hands. Sprinkle the cinnamon mixture over the buttered dough.
            </li>
            <li>Tightly roll the dough lengthwise. Use a serrated knife to cut 1 1/2-inch pieces. You should
                end up with 12 to 14 pieces. Place 6 to 7 of the buns in the two prepared pans about 1/2 inch apart.
                COver the cake pan with a towel and allow the buns to rise for another 15 to 30 minutes. Remove the towel and bake the buns for 25 minutes, until golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>While the buns are baking, make the icing by thoroughly mixing the cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, cinnamon, and salt together in a medium bowl.
                Pour the melted butter in the bowl and mix. Add the milk and mix until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>When you take the buns out of the oven, immediately drizzle the icing on top and serve.</li>
